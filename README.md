# Portfolio Project
This was my very first challenge on the _nology software development course. The first half of the challenge was to create a preliminary wireframe design on Figma for desktop, mobile and tablet versions of the site. These can be found here:  https://www.figma.com/file/mxkDnyUjO2DKsc5EOzJsBZ/Portfolio-Mk-3?node-id=0%3A1.

The second half of the challenge was to create a fully-working, responsive version of the site, including everything I had learnt to this point. You can check out my new portfolio page here... https://rensormani.github.io/renato-sormani-portfolio/

# What I used
• HTML • CSS • BEM • GitHub • Git

# The Brief
Build a fully functional portfolio using just HTML and CSS that can be progressively updated throughout the course.

# The Functionality
• I used HTML and CSS to develop this functional portfolio page. Creating a single, vertical scrolling page that features an About, Experience, Work and Contact section.

• The Work section is the area that showcases my projects. I used CSS grid to create an attractive, fully-responsive layout for the project display.
